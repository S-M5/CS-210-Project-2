# CS-210-Project-2
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
~The project was designed to calculate monthly yield of deposits in the event of a flat rate percentage and adjustable deposits.

#What did you do particularly well?
~I felt i did well making the final product work and provide acurate calculations. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
~I felt my code was messy and is very limited when accounting for current market adjustments and projections. I would need to simply take more time to clean up and simplify the code as well as give it access to curent market data and projections with reactive calculations. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
~I felt the code that was tedious to code was calculations rounding at the wrong times resulting in a break from accurate data. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
~In the financial world the skills are transferable when programming an accurate fixed rate calculator or any calculator for interest, or dividend calculations.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
~I ensured that any bugs were ironed out, easy read and provide data to, and made the code simplistic enough to provide accurate results with the simple data.
